# Group 4 Project Overview
Weatherly is a web application that suits all your needs regarding the weather. It lets the user select a city and display the cities' weather, while showing an option between hourly, daily, and weekly forecasts. These information will range from the high and low temperatures, wind speed, humidity, visibility, and what the temperature feels like. Aside from forecasts, the webpage will also contain weather maps, which displays a map of the surrounding area, color coded according to the temperature, and news regarding the weather.
